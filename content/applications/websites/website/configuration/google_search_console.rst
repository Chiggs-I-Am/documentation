Google Search Console
=====================

Google Search Console is a free web service provided by Google that allows website owners to monitor,
maintain, and troubleshoot their site's presence in Google Search results. It offers valuable insights
into how Google views and interacts with your site, helping you optimize its performance.

To enable GSC, go to `Google Search Console <https://search.google.com/search-console/welcome>`_,
enter your domain or URL prefix, follow the instructions, and download the code from Google.

Then, return to your database and enable the Google Search Console by going to
:menuselection:`Website --> Configuration --> Settings` and enable :guilabel:`Google Search Console`
in the :guilabel:`SEO` section. Enter the code in the dedicated field.

.. warning::
   Mapping your domain name with your Odoo website prevents Google from indexing both your custom
   domain name *www.example.com* and your original odoo database address *example.odoo.com*.
