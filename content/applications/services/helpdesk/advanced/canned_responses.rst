Canned responses
================

In order to streamline the process of answering customer inquiries, the *Helpdesk* application
allows for the use of *canned responses*. Canned responses are customizable inputs where a shortcut
stands in for a longer response. An operator enters a keyword shortcut, which is then automatically
replaced by the expanded substitution response.

   *Canned responses* are managed through the *Live Chat* application. In order to utilize this
   feature, the *Live Chat* app **must** be installed on the database. The *Helpdesk* team does
   **not** have to have *live Chat* enabled in order to use canned responses will responding to
   tickets.

What are canned responses
