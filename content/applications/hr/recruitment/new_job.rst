Job positions
=============

In the default :menuselection:`Recruitment` dashboard view, all job positions are shown, including
positions being actively recruited for as well as inactive positions.

Each job position is shown in an individual Kanban card. If the job position is active and candidate
 can apply, a :guilabel:`Published` banner appears in the top-right corner of the card.

View submitted applications by clicking anywhere on a job position card.

Create a new job position
=========================

Create a new job position from the main Recruitment dashboard. Click the :guilabel:`New` button in
the top-left corner, and a :guilabel:`Create a Job Position` pop-up window appears.

First, enter the name of the position (such as `Sales Manager`, `Mechanical Engineer`, etc.).

Next, enter an :guilabel:`Application email` by typing in the first half of the email address in the
first field, then select the second half of the email using the drop-down menu. Applicants can send
a resumé to this specific email address, then Odoo creates an application for them automatically.

When complete, click the :guilabel:`Create` button to save the entry, or the :guilabel:`Discard`
button to delete it.

.. image:: new_job/job-title.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Create a new job position.

Once the job position has been created, it appears as a card in the Kanban view on the main
:guilabel:`Recruitment` dashboard.

Edit a new job position
-----------------------

After the job position is created, it's time to enter the details for the position. Click on the
:guilabel:`⋮ (three dots)` icon in the upper-right corner of the relevant card to reveal several
options, and then click :guilabel:`Configuration` to edit the details.

.. image:: new_job/edit-job.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Edit the job position card.

All the basic information about the job position is listed under the :guilabel:`Recruitment` tab.

None of the fields are required, but it is a good idea to configure and populate at a minimum the
:guilabel:`Department`, :guilabel:`Location`, :guilabel:`Employment Type`, and :guilabel:`Job
Summary` fields as they are all visible to prospective applicants on the website.

The fields can be filled out as follows:

- :guilabel:`Department`: select the relevant department for the job position. This is visible on
  the website.
- :guilabel:`Job Location`: select the physical address for the job. If the job position is remote,
  leave this field blank. This is visible on the website.
- :guilabel:`Email Alias`: enter an email address that applicants can send a resumé  to. Once
  emailed, Odoo automatically creates an application for them.
- :guilabel:`Employment Type`: select what type of position the job is, using the drop-down menu.
  The default options are :guilabel:`Permanent`, :guilabel:`Temporary`, :guilabel:`Seasonal`,
  :guilabel:`Interim`, :guilabel:`Full-Time`, and :guilabel:`Part-Time`. This is visible on the
  website.
- :guilabel:`Company`: select the company the job is for. This field only appears if in a
  multi-company database.
- :guilabel:`Target`: enter the number of employees to be hired for this position.
- :guilabel:`Is Published`: activate this option to publish the job online.
- :guilabel:`Website`: select the website the job is published on.

- :guilabel:`Interviewers`: select who should perform the interviews. Multiple people can be
  selected.
- :guilabel:`Interview Form`: select an :ref:`Interview form <interview>` that applicants fill out
  prior to their interview.
- :guilabel:`Contract Template`: select a contract template to be used when offering the job to a
  candidate.
- :guilabel:`Process Details` section: this section contains information that is displayed online
  for the job position. This informs the applicants of the timeline and steps for the recruitment
  process, so they know when to expect a reply.

  - :guilabel:`Time to Answer`: enter the number of days before the applicant is contacted.
  - :guilabel:`Process`: enter the various stages the candidate goes through during the recruitment
    process.
  - :guilabel:`Days to get an Offer`: enter the number of days before the applicant should expect
    an offer after the recruitment process has ended.

.. note::
   The :guilabel:`Process Details` section is a text field. All answers are typed in rather than
   selected from a drop-down menu. The text is displayed on the website exactly as it appears in
   this tab.

Finally, enter the job description in the :guilabel:`Job Summary` tab.

.. image:: new_job/recruitment-tab.png

.. _interview:

Create interview form
---------------------

An *Interview Form* is used to determine if a candidate is a good fit for a job position. Interview
forms can be as specific or general as desired, and can take the form of a certification, an exam,
or a general questionnaire. Interview forms are determined by the recruitment team.

Before creating an interview form, ensure the proper settings are enabled. Navigate to
:menuselection:`Recruitment app --> Configuration --> Settings`. Under the :guilabel:`Recruitment
Process` section, ensure the :guilabel:`Send Interview Survey` option is enabled.

All interview forms must be created, there are no pre-configured forms in Odoo. To create an
interview form, start from the :guilabel:`Recruitment` tab of the :guilabel:`Job Position` form. In
the :guilabel:`Interview Form` field, enter a name for the new interview form. As the name is typed,
several options populate beneath the entry, :guilabel:`Create (interview form name)`,
:guilabel:`Search More...`, and :guilabel:`Create and edit...`. Click :guilabel:`Create and edit...`
and a :guilabel:`Create Interview Form` pop-up window appears.

.. note::
   The option :guilabel:`Search More...` only appears if there are any interview forms already
   created. If no interview forms exist, the only options available are :guilabel:`Create (interview
   form name)`, and :guilabel:`Create and edit...`.

First, enter a name for the form in the :guilabel:`Name` field. This should be indicative of when
the form should be used. For example, is the form specific to a job position, or is it a general
form that can be used for all recruitment scenarios?

Next, select the kind of interview form being created. The default is :guilabel:`Custom`, which is
pre-selected. The various options are :guilabel:`Survey`, :guilabel:`Live session`,
:guilabel:`Assessment`, and :guilabel:`Custom`.

Then select the person responsible for the form from the drop-down menu for the
:guilabel:`Responsible` field.

If desired, an image can be added to the interview form. Mouse over the camera icon on the far right
and a :guilabel:`✏️ (pencil)` icon appears. Click the :guilabel:`✏️ (pencil)` icon and a file
explorer window appears. Navigate to the desired image file, then click :guilabel:`Open` to select
it.

.. image:: new_job/create-interview-form.png
   :align: center
   :alt: The top portion of the new interview form with everything filled out and selected.

Questions
~~~~~~~~~

In the :guilabel:`Questions` tab, click on :guilabel:`Add a section` to add a section to the form. A
line appears, and a section heading can be entered. When complete, click off the line, or press
enter to lock in the new section on the form.

Next, click :guilabel:`Add a question` to add a question to the section. A :guilabel:`Create
Sections and Questions` pop-up window appears where the question details are entered. Type out the
question in the top line.

There are several :guilabel:`Question Types` to choose from:

- :guilabel:`Multiple choice: only one answer`: a multiple choice question that only allows the
  candidate to select one answer
- :guilabel:`Multiple choice: multiple answers allowed`: a multiple choice question that allows the
  candidate to select multiple answers
- :guilabel:`Multiple Lines Text Box`: allows the applicant to enter several lines of text
- :guilabel:`Single Line Text Box`: limits the applicant to only a single line of text
- :guilabel:`Numerical Value`: only allows a number to be entered
- :guilabel:`Date`: a calendar module is presented to select a date
- :guilabel:`Datetime`: a calendar module and a clock icon is presented to select a date and time
- :guilabel:`Matrix`: a customizable table that allows the candidate to choose an answer for each
  row

After selecting a question type, a sample question appears in gray. This represents how the question
will be displayed to applicants.

.. image:: new_job/questions.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Add a new question to the interview form.

Questions and sections can be reorganized. Move them by clicking and dragging individual section
headings or question lines to their desired position(s).

Sections are indicated by a gray background, while questions have a white background.

Answers
*******

If :guilabel:`Multiple choice: only one answer`, :guilabel:`Multiple choice: multiple answers
allowed`, :guilabel:`Single Line Text Box`, or :guilabel:`Matrix` is selected for the
:guilabel:`Question Type`, an :guilabel:`Answers` tab appears beneath the question. If another
question type is selected, the :guilabel:`Answers` tab remains hidden from view.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Multiple choice

      For both the :guilabel:`Multiple choice: only one answer` and :guilabel:`Multiple choice:
      multiple answers allowed` question type, the answers are populated in the same way.

      First, in the :guilabel:`Answers` tab, click :guilabel:`Add a line`. A line appears, and an
      answer can be entered. After typing in the answer, click off the line, or press enter to lock
      in the new answer on the form and have another answer line appear.

      If desired, an image can be attached to the answer. Click on a line to select it, and an
      :guilabel:`Upload your file` button appears on the right side. Click the :guilabel:`Upload
      your file` button and a file explorer window appears. Navigate to the image file, select it,
      then click :guilabel:`Open` to select it.

      Repeat this for all the answers to be added for the multiple choice question. The answers can
      be rearranged in any order. To move an answer, click on the six small squares on the far left
      of each answer line, and drag the answer to the desired position. The order the answers appear
      in the form is the order the answers will appear online.

      To delete a line, click on the :guilabel:`🗑️ (trash can)` icon on the far right side of the
      answer line.

      .. image:: new_job/multi-answers.png
         :align: center
         :alt: Answers to a multiple choice question, where each line has a different answer listed.

   .. tab:: Single Line Text Box

      If the :guilabel:`Single Line Text Box` question type is selected, only two checkboxes appear
      in the :guilabel:`Answers` tab:

      - :guilabel:`Input must be an email`: activate this option if the answer must be in the format
        of an email address.

        - :guilabel:`Save as user email?`: this option appears if :guilabel:`Input must be an email`
          is selected. This saves the email entered on the form as the user's email, and will be
          used anytime Odoo contacts the user via email.

      - :guilabel:`Save as user nickname?`: activate this option to populate the answer as the
        user's nickname. This is stored and used anywhere Odoo uses a nickname.

      .. image:: new_job/single-line.png
         :align: center
         :alt: The three possible checkboxes that can appear if a single line of text is selected
               for the question type.

   .. tab:: Matrix

      Sometimes, a question is asked that does not fit a standard answer format, and is best suited
      for a matrix. For example, asking an applicant what is their availability to work compared to
      the various shifts is a perfect question for a matrix format. In this example, an applicant
      can click on all the shifts they are available to work.

      For a :guilabel:`Matrix` question type, there are two sets of data that need to be input. The
      rows and columns must both be configured. The columns are represented by the
      :guilabel:`Choices` section, while the rows are configured in the :guilabel:`Rows` section.

      The method for populating both sections is the same. In the :guilabel:`Answers` tab, click
      :guilabel:`Add a line` in either the :guilabel:`Choices` or :guilabel:`Row` section. A line
      appears, and an answer can be entered. After typing in the answer, click off the line, or
      press enter to lock in the new answer on the form and have another answer line appear. Repeat
      this for all answers for both the :guilabel:`Choices` and :guilabel:`Rows` sections.

      .. example::
         This is a matrix that asks an applicant what shifts they are available to work on Saturdays
         and Sundays only, and the available options for those two days are either morning,
         afternoon, or evening.

            :alt: A matrix set up to ask about availability on Saturday and Sunday mornings,
                  afternoons, and evenings.

.. _print:

Print
*****

In some cases, it may be necessary or beneficial to print the interview survey instead of sending it
electronically. To print a copy of the survey, click the :guilabel:`Print` button in the top-left of
the survey form.

The survey loads in a new tab. From here, the survey can be printed or saved as a PDF.
